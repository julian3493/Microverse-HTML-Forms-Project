# HTML Forms project Microverse

> We are Microverse students doing some basic HTML and CSS project. We created a basic HTML Structure based on the sign up form for the mint page.

![screenshot](./assets/img/app_screenshot.png)

We created a header where there are some information on how to Sign In on the site. We divided the main section in three containers. The first one has the Intuit Company logos for mint, quickbooks and turbotax. The second one contains the main form to fill in the informations to create the account. Finally the third one has the reCaptcha message from Google. The footer section was built with a Privacy Button with a fixed position at the lower right page and some information about copyrights.
